		<h2>Jewelry</h2>
	<p>Working with jewelry is a great medium to learn how to problem solve, where I think about the relationship of space and think about usability. Planning a project is step one, creating is step two and clean up work is step three.</p> 

	<p>You can not skip a step, you need to plan and know that each step will take time. Jewelry is wearable art, it is what gets passed down, it is small and quality pieces will out live us all.</p>
