		<h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>I have recently started taking photographs as a way to help me think about layout, cropping and capturing different textures. I sometimes use the photographs as reference points for thinking about other projects. I love to collaborate on projects with photographers and I think that taking some of my own photographs helps me to articulate ideas.</p> 

		<p>All of these images are taken from places that mean a lot to me. The water image and bench image I took while hanging out at one of my favorite places in the world, where I was born, Mats Mats Bay. My grandpa built a dock that makes a great sitting spot and I took these one morning while I enjoyed the view.</p> 

		<p>The old boat is from a different area of the bay, I have watched this boat change over time, getting more character along the way. I took the shot of an old dairy truck while leaving a babyshower on a farm in Chimacum.</p>
