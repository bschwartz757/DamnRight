		<h2>Design Projects</h2>
        <p>I am always looking at how things are displayed and communicated and thinking about our relationship to objects. Creating the bridgework for allowing people to make emotional connections to objects. I believe that good design is simple, but the longer you look, the more you see.</p>
         
		<p>I love working with people and see myself contributing to the success of my clients and co workers by helping to make their visions a reality. I have learned a lot about color, space, design and marketing throughout my career as a hairstylist. My experiences have given me the professional sense to ask the right questions to clients so that I can help clarify what they are looking for and give suggestions to expand on their vision.</p>

		<h3>Bath Salts Project</h3>
        <p>After thinking about what I wanted to create I came to the conclusion that I wanted something that reminded me of how wet hair looks falling down the back of your neck. I wanted to create something that felt modern, yet soft, gender neutral and bold.</p>

		<h3>Process</h3>
        <p>I created my hair texture with charcoal. I did several different versions, I experimented with putting them in Illustrator, but I felt that I lost some of the organic feel so I kept them in Photoshop. I did my first ever mock up of a project, just for fun.</p>

		<h2>Home</h2>
        <p>I am always looking at how things are designed and thinking about how they can be improved upon. I believe that how we merge and remix ideas, pushing ourselves to not be derivative but to represent ourselves in a fresh way is what expands the boundaries.</p>
