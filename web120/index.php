		<h2>Home</h2>     
        <p>I am always looking at how things are designed and thinking about how they can be improved upon. I believe that how we merge and remix ideas, pushing ourselves to not be derivative but to represent ourselves in a fresh way is what expands the boundaries.</p>
         
		<p>I love working with people and see myself contributing to the success of my clients and co workers by helping to make their visions a reality. I have learned a lot about color, space, design and marketing throughout my career as a hairstylist. My experiences have given me the professional sense to ask the right questions to clients so that I can help clarify what they are looking for and give suggestions to expand on their vision.</p>

		<h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>I love solving visual problems, and I enjoy collaborating with other people or just throwing ideas around. I am constantly seeking to improve myself and I actively seek feedback from others, and I also like giving feedback to help my peers.</p>
