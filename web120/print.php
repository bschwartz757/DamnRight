		<h2>Printmaking</h2>
	<p>Printmaking is great for your brain because it teaches us to think about the reverse, when carving out a block you need to think that what you are taking away will be the light and what you are leaving will be the dark.</p> 

	<p>I really enjoyed working on all of these prints, but I enjoyed monotype printing the most, it is very unpredictable and allows you to create countless layers. Every monotype is one of a kind, the risks are large, so it is nice to work on overcoming the fear of messing something up.</p>

		<h3>Block Print</h3>
        <p>My first print that I ever did was this linoleum block print. While working on this design I learned a lot about directional line qualities and relation to each other to create grey.</p> 
        
        <p>I based my design on a photograph that I had taken, while visiting an old haunt from my past. Forgotten trailers, cars and boats started to fade into the surroundings. Everything had a layer of depression as thick as the moss growing on it.</p>
